## What this does

The **Nightly Forge** pipeline uses [Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
and [nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) to
build a ready-to-deploy NixOS `.vhd` image every night at midnight UTC (and on
every push to `main`).  The resulting image is uploaded as a GitHub Release
tagged with the build timestamp (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM`).

## How to customise the image

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Edit `core_pulse.nix`** — this is the only file you normally need to
   touch:

   ```nix
   # core_pulse.nix
   { pkgs, ... }:
   {
     environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
       git curl wget htop vim
       # Add your tools here ↓
       tmux python3 awscli2
     ];

     users.users.alice = {
       isNormalUser = true;
       extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];
       openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [
         "ssh-ed25519 AAAA... alice@myhost"
       ];
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Push to `main`**.  The workflow will pick it up, build a fresh image, and
   publish a GitHub Release automatically.

---

## Building locally

You need [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) with flakes enabled.

```bash
# Build the Azure VHD
nix build .#azureImage

# The image will be available at ./result/
ls result/
```

---

## Deploying to Azure

1. Upload the `.vhd` from the GitHub Release to an **Azure Storage Account**.
2. Create a **Managed Image** from the blob.
3. Launch a VM from that image.

The default `core_pulse.nix` disables password authentication; make sure you
have added your SSH public key before building.

## Azure CI setup (one-time bootstrap)

The nightly build always runs in GitHub Actions, but the **smoke-test** and
**janitor** workflows need to talk to Azure. To keep client secrets out of the
repo, authentication is done via **GitHub OIDC federation** to a Microsoft
Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) service principal. The `scripts/bootstrap-azure-ci.sh` helper provisions
everything in Azure and prints the values you need to paste into GitHub.

> Run this **once, locally**, as a user with **Owner** on the target
> subscription. Do not run it from CI — CI's own service principal must not be
> able to grant itself new permissions.

### Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription you own (or have `Owner` on).
* [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed
  and logged in: `az login`.
* Your GitHub repository (fork) already pushed to `github.com`.
* `bash` (the script is POSIX-ish `bash`, tested on Linux and macOS).

### Preparing the parameters

Gather these values before running the script — they are what wire up the
OIDC trust between GitHub and Azure:

| Flag | What it is | How to get it |
|------|------------|---------------|
| `--subscription` | The Azure subscription ID the RGs will live in. | `az account show --query id -o tsv` |
| `--location` | Azure region for the resource groups (e.g. `southeastasia`, `eastus`). | Pick any region close to you; it only affects the RG metadata and where the smoke-test VM will run. |
| `--github-repo` | Your GitHub repo in `owner/name` form. **Must match exactly** — it becomes the `sub` claim the OIDC token is validated against. | e.g. `poomnupong/nixos-azure-builder` (or `yourname/your-fork`). |
| `--budget-email` | Email address for the Layer-4 budget alert (80% of monthly spend). | Any mailbox you check. |
| `--run-rg-count` *(optional)* | How many run resource groups to create (default `2`). | Two is enough; increase only if smoke tests overlap. |
| `--control-rg` *(optional)* | Name of the shared control RG (default `rg-nixos-ci-control`). | |
| `--run-rg-prefix` *(optional)* | Prefix for the run RG names (default `rg-nixos-ci-run`, yielding `rg-nixos-ci-run-01`, `-02`, …). | |
| `--sp-name` *(optional)* | Display name of the service principal (default `sp-nixos-azure-builder-ci`). | |
| `--budget-amount` *(optional)* | Monthly budget in USD (default `10`). | |

The script is **idempotent** — re-running it reconciles state instead of
creating duplicates.

### Running the bootstrap

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap-azure-ci.sh \
  --subscription <sub-id> \
  --location southeastasia \
  --github-repo <your-gh-user>/nixos-azure-builder \
  --budget-email you@example.com
```

What it does:

1. Creates the control RG and `N` run RGs.
2. Creates a Microsoft Entra ID application + service principal with **federated
   credentials** trusting tokens from GitHub Actions for:
   * `ref:refs/heads/main` (nightly build + smoke test)
   * `environment:azure-janitor` (daily janitor)
3. Grants the SP `Contributor` on each run RG and `Reader` on the control RG.
4. Creates a monthly subscription budget with an email notification (Layer 4
   backstop).
5. Prints the GitHub Secrets / Variables you need to configure.

### Wiring the output into GitHub

After the script finishes, configure these under **Settings → Secrets and
variables → Actions** in your repo:

**Secrets**

* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` — the app registration's `appId` (printed by the script).
* `AZURE_TENANT_ID` — your Microsoft Entra ID tenant ID (printed by the script).
* `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` — the subscription ID you passed in.

**Variables**

* `AZURE_LOCATION` — e.g. `southeastasia`.
* `AZURE_CONTROL_RG` — e.g. `rg-nixos-ci-control`.
* `AZURE_RUN_RGS` — space-separated list, e.g. `rg-nixos-ci-run-01 rg-nixos-ci-run-02`.

**Environment**

Create an Actions environment named **`azure-janitor`** (Settings →
Environments → New environment). Its name appears in the federated credential
subject the janitor workflow uses to obtain an OIDC token, so the name must
match exactly.

For deeper architectural details (why RBAC survives run-RG teardown, the four
cleanup layers, what to do when an RG is stuck) see
[`docs/ci-azure.md`](docs/ci-azure.md).

## Version format

Releases are tagged `YYYYMMDD-HHMM` (UTC), e.g. `20260324-0000`.  
The tag is generated by `get_version.sh`:

```bash
./get_version.sh   # → 20260324-0426
```
